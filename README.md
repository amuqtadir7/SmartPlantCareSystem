# 🌱 IoT-based Smart Plant Care System

This project presents a Smart Plant Care System developed using IoT technology.  
It leverages real-time environmental monitoring and hydroponic integration for efficient plant growth.

## 🚀 Features
- Real-time temperature and humidity monitoring (DHT22 Sensor)
- Soil moisture sensing and automatic watering
- Motion detection and alert warnings
- Remote monitoring through Blynk IoT App
- Low-cost and scalable

## 🛠 Hardware Components
- NodeMCU ESP8266 WiFi Module
- Soil Moisture Sensor
- DHT22 Temperature and Humidity Sensor
- Relay Module (for water pump control)
- Motion sensor
- Bread Board
- Water pump

## 💻 Software Components
- Arduino IDE
- Blynk IoT App (Android/iOS)
- Blynk Cloud Server

## ⚙️ Working Principle
- Sensors continuously capture plant environment data.
- NodeMCU transmits data to Blynk cloud via Wi-Fi.
- User monitors real-time values on a mobile dashboard.
- Automated system turns on water pump if soil moisture drops below a threshold.
